# 69LibAPI Documentation

69Lib is a library/book storage management API, it help both users and administrators perform basic CRUD operations on a library database

## Installation

Follow this process only if you want to use the API locally


### Dependencies

First clone the repo or download it as a zip

Once done you will need [python](https://python.org) 3.10.0 or higher

And the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) or [pip3](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)

We recomment using a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)

By running

```bash
pip -r requirements.txt
or
pip3 -r requirements.txt
```
You will install the required modules inside the *requirements.txt* file

The key dependencies for this project are:
* [Flask](https://flask.com)
* [SQLAlchemy](https://sqlalchemy.com)

Once you are done go ahead and run

__For MacOs or Linux__ 
```bash
export FLASK_APP=flaskr
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run

```

__For Windows__ 
```bash
set FLASK_APP=<file_name.py>
set FLASK_ENV=development
flask run

```  

In certain cases you might need to add
```bash
$env:FLASK_APP = "<file_name.py>"
```
## Usage

The API is based on a one to many relationship between categories and books. Thus we have the following routes

We assume all routes are preceded by the API's url which is __https://library-69-api.herokuapp.com/__

 __GET__ ALL BOOKS


```
~/books       
```

This route like most of the other ones send back an array of 3 elements:
* A "Success" field which is equal to True if the request is approved
* A "books" field which contains every book in the database in a json format
* A "total" field which is basically the number of books in the library

 __GET__ A BOOK BY ITS ID

```
~/books/<booksId>
```
Returns two fiels: 
* "Success" 
* And "book" which is the requested book

 __GET__ A CATEGORY BY ITS ID

```
~/categories/<categoryId>
```

Returns two fiels: 
* "Success" 
* And "category" which is the requested category

 __GET__ ALL CATEGORIES
```
~/categories
```
Returns three fiels: 
* "Success" 
* "categories" which is an array of all categories in json format
* "total" the number of categories in the library

 __GET__ ALL BOOKS FROM A CATEGORY
```
~/categories/<categoryId>/books
```
Returns four fiels: 
* "Success" 
* "books" which is an array of all books in the requested category
* "total" the number of books returned
* "label" the requested category's label

 __DELETE__ A BOOK/CATEGORY

These routes will only respond to *DELETE* requests
```
~/categories/<categoryId>      or
~/books/<bookId>
```
Returns twofiels: 
* "Success" 
* "deleted book/category" a json format of the item you just deleted

 __UPDATE__ A BOOK/CATEGORY

These routes will only respond to *PATCH* or *PUT* requests
```
~/categories/<categoryId>..params..      or
~/books/<bookId>..params
```

For example we want to update the category (1, "Culinar) to (1, "Tech review")

The route would then be 
```
~/categories1?label=Tech%20review
```
Note that you can just update the category's label as it is it's only mutable attribute(the other one being the id), the books have many more fields to update .

Returns twofiels: 
* "Success" 
* "updated book/category" a json format of the item you just updated


## Error handling

You can come accross three types of error while using the 69LibAPI
### Error 400: Bad Request
If you get this error then you might want to double check your request, look for possible typos or missing params when updating

### Error 405: Method not allowed

The method you are using to access the route is not defined for that route, you might want to double check the route or the methods

### Error 404: Not found

The ressource you are looking for is either not on the server anymore or have never been on it

### Error 500: Internal Server

Here you are not the one to blame, this means we have a problem on our server, this is where you become the hero
